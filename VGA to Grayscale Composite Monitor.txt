VGA to Grayscale Composite Monitor

This will only work if you can program the video card to produce a compatible resolution and scan rate.
If you would like to experiment, here is a really simple circuit that may work well enough for combining Hsync, Vsync, and one of the VGA color signals, say green, into a composite video.

If the monitor sense lines on the VGA connector are tied MS1 (pin 12) = GND, MS0 (pin 11) = no connect, then some programs will default to monochrome and use a reasonable color map. I don't know how you will get a reasonable mapping to monochrome for the others.

All you will need are 4 resistors.

I am calling your connector on the monitor 'Composite Video In'.

Hsync through 500-1K ohm (R1) to Composite Video In.
Vsync through 500-1K ohm (R2) to Composite Video In.
Green Video through 200 ohm (R3 - variable) to Composite Video In.
Green Video side of R3 to Ground through an 82 ohm (R4) resistor.
Tie this ground to the BNC or RCA connector ground.

                   /                    |
                   |                    |

It is essential that all this be built as close to the monitor as possible for best signal quality.
